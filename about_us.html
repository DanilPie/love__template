		<p> (1) Our acquaintance <i class="far fa-comment-dots"></i></p>
		<span> I remember your first like on my photo on Instagram and I then liked you back,<br> because you are beautiful (and it didn't seem to me). I didn't know what to write,<br> and in the hope that you will answer, I posted a cute  story with Vanya. You wrote <br>to me when I was walking in the woods and I immediately replied, I remember  that <br>I was happy and we immediately struck up a conversation. We chatted for about <br>two weeks (I don’t  remember exactly, but it seems like that), and then we decided <br>to meet.</span>
</div>
<div class="chat_text_item">
		<p> (2) First impression <i class="far fa-grin-hearts"></i></p>
		<span> Before our meeting, I was very worried, to be honest. I really liked you<br> from the photos and in  and I wanted to make a good impression. <br>I bought blueberries, because, at that time, you already told<br> me that you are celebrating it. And now I see you ...<br> Many may have told you that you are more beautiful in life than<br>in the photo, well, so as not to repeat them and be honest<br> with you, I will say that you are not only more beautiful, but also super<br>good and honey</span>

		<p> (3) First walk  <i class="fas fa-male"></i><i class="fas fa-female"></i></p>
		<span> I met so many different people every single day and have so many friends over <br> the years, but  meeting you for the first time was something special, the vibe, <br> the force and the feeling was different. It was more unique and special. Your for-<br>ce of attraction was super strong, which immediately pulled me more closer <br>to you.</span>
</div>
<div class="chat_text_item">
		<p> (4) Just frends <i class="fas fa-user-friends"></i></p>
		<span> I remember too bad the days when we were just friends,  but you were <br> always very kind and considerate to me. For a long time I did not <br> understand this and did not give value to your efforts. Most likely, <br>simply because I was  very stupid or because I have never had such  a  <br>friendship with anyone. I am very grateful to fate that we passed this <br> stage and soon became not only teaching friends, but also soulmates.</span>

		<p> (5) Soulmates <i class="fas fa-hand-holding-heart" style="position: relative;top: -3px;"></i></p>
		<span> Now sitting here and typing, I realized that for me personally, we have moved to <br> the level of "more than just friends" from January 8, 2021.The day we went<br> for a walk with your youngest sister. That day I met your mother and for the <br>first time I felt something like sympathy for you. Since then, my life has become <br>much better, because I always have a person who will support, listen and, if <br>necessary, give advice. I have become very attached to you from that moment.</span>

<div class="chat_text_item">
		<p> (6) WE LOVE EACH OTHER <i class="fas fa-heart" style="font-size: 20px;"></i> </p>
		<span> 10/28/2021 the happiest period in my life began. I don’t understand <br>how I didn’t feel and didn’t notice feelings for you before. Apparently, <br>everything has its time. Every day,when I wake up, I think about you, <br>take the phone to write you good morning, darling. More than any-<br>thing, I'm afraid of losing you. I hope that our relationship is exactly<br> that fairy tale-exception that will last forever. I love and accept you<br> for who you are and I want us to become better only next to each <br>other.</span>
